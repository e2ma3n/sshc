# sshc - Managing and connecting to ssh without password 
## Introduction
when number of accesses to ssh gets high, managment gets hard, so in this time you can use this program for managing servers. By using this program you can select your server from menu and connect to server without password or add public ip address to server's firewall (iptables).

## Why we should use sshc program ?

- Because i hate to set all root password for 123456
- Because i need to encrypt my password in my Gnu-Linux machine
- Because i trust openssl and aes-256-cbc encryption algorithms
- Because is easier to read couple line from shell script instead of third party binaries
- etc

## How to get source code ?
You can download and view source code from github : https://github.com/e2ma3n/sshc

Also to get the latest source code, run following command:
```
# git clone https://github.com/e2ma3n/sshc.git
```
This will create sshc directory in your current directory and source files are stored there.

## How to check dependencies on system ?
In the first step, set execute permission for install.sh :
```
# cd sshc
# chmod +x install.sh
```
Then, check dependencies, using -c switch :
```
# ./install -c
```

## How to install dependencies on debian ?
By using apt-get command; for example :
```
# apt-get install sshpass
# apt-get install curl
...
```

## How to install sshc ?
By using -i switch :
```
# ./install.sh -i
```

## How to uninstall ?
```
# rm -rf /opt/sshc/
# rm -f /usr/bin/sshc
```
